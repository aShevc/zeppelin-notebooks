{"name":"Zeppelin-notebooks","tagline":"Apache Zeppelin notebooks for YCSB","body":"# Zeppelin Notebooks\r\n\r\nContains required configurations and bootstrap notebooks for Apache Zeppelin.\r\n\r\n### Running on Marathon\r\n\r\n`marathon` dir contains necessary files for running Zeppelin with supplied bootstrap notebooks and configurations \r\non Marathon. In order to gather all necessary files in one dir:\r\n\r\n```\r\n./marathon-build.sh\r\n```\r\n\r\nTo run on Marathon, upload all the files of the `build` directory somewhere, where `marathon/zeppelin.json` would be \r\nable to reach them. In order to run against Marathon:\r\n\r\n```\r\ncurl -X PUT -d@zeppelin.json -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" http://leader.mesos.service:18080/v2/apps/zeppelin\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Export notebooks and configurations\r\n\r\nAfter you have created and tested your notebooks, and want to export them, for example to launch them at Zeppelin start \r\nup, you should copy `notebook/<notebook-id>` folder from the Zeppelin running directory. So, for example, if running\r\non Marathon, go to your Mesos UI, see where on the Mesos slave Zeppelin instance is running, and copy desired notebook \r\n`note.json` via scp:\r\n\r\n```\r\nscp centos@slave0:/<path-to-zeppelin-dir>/notebook/<notebook-id>/note.json notebook/<notebook-id>/\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou may also want to export your interpreter configurations, if want them to be applied on start up. In this case all \r\nyou need to do is to copy your `conf/interpreter.json`. When running on Marathon exporting it would look like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\nscp centos@slave0:/<path-to-zeppelin-dir>/conf/interpreter.json conf/\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Notebook jar dependencies\r\n\r\nIf there are some jar dependencies needed to be provided for running your notebooks, place them into `notebook-deps` \r\ndirectory. They will be provided along with Zeppelin dist, when you deploy the app with Marathon. You will be able to \r\nload them as a dependency by running the following paragraph:\r\n\r\n```\r\n%dep\r\nz.load(\"../notebook-deps/<jar-name>.jar\")\r\n```\r\n\r\n**NOTE:** This should be run *before* launching Spark interpreter, which means before any Spark paragraphs, in other \r\ncase Zeppelin should be restarted\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
